# HuffmanTree

The overall function of the program is the following: The inputs are (a) a flag that takes either
value -en or -de, representing ”encode” and ”decode” respectively, (b) a file Name.txt containing,
for a specific friend called Name, the frequency of each character in your messaging history with
Name so far, and (c) another file called message.txt, that either contains a human-readable or a
binary message . In both cases, the Huffman tree for the given frequencies is computed. Then,
according to the Huffman Tree, and depending to the value of the flag, it outputs either the optimal
binary encoding (as a string of 0 and 1) of the human-readable message.txt, or the decoding of
the binary message.txt.
